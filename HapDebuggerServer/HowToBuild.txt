2.  Download and install Python (www.python.org)

3.  Create a "PYTHON_ROOT" environment variable and set it to point to the root python directory

4.  Open the Hap.sln solution in Visual C++

5.  Build the HapClient project

A console window will appear which the python script will run in.  The python 
script will automatically break before the first line of python code.

To debug a remote script:
1.  Open the script in the IDE.
2.  On the remote machine, run the "HapClient.exe" program - a conlole
